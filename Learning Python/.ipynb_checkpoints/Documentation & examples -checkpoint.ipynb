      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to\n",
      "    those found in Perl.  It supports both 8-bit and Unicode strings; both\n",
      "    the pattern and the strings being processed can contain null bytes and\n",
      "    characters outside the US ASCII range.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters.\n",
      "    Most ordinary characters, like \"A\", \"a\", or \"0\", are the simplest\n",
      "    regular expressions; they simply match themselves.  You can\n",
      "    concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The special characters are:\n",
      "        \".\"      Matches any character except a newline.\n",
      "        \"^\"      Matches the start of the string.\n",
      "        \"$\"      Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at\n",
      "                 the end of the string.\n",
      "        \"*\"      Matches 0 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.\n",
      "                 Greedy means that it will match as many repetitions as possible.\n",
      "        \"+\"      Matches 1 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.\n",
      "        \"?\"      Matches 0 or 1 (greedy) of the preceding RE.\n",
      "        *?,+?,?? Non-greedy versions of the previous three special characters.\n",
      "        {m,n}    Matches from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE.\n",
      "        {m,n}?   Non-greedy version of the above.\n",
      "        \"\\\\\"     Either escapes special characters or signals a special sequence.\n",
      "        []       Indicates a set of characters.\n",
      "                 A \"^\" as the first character indicates a complementing set.\n",
      "        \"|\"      A|B, creates an RE that will match either A or B.\n",

      "        (?aiLmsux) The letters set the corresponding flags defined below.\n",
      "        (?:...)  Non-grouping version of regular parentheses.\n",
      "        (?P<name>...) The substring matched by the group is accessible by name.\n",
      "        (?P=name)     Matches the text matched earlier by the group named name.\n",
      "        (?#...)  A comment; ignored.\n",
      "        (?=...)  Matches if ... matches next, but doesn't consume the string.\n",
      "        (?!...)  Matches if ... doesn't match next.\n",
      "        (?<=...) Matches if preceded by ... (must be fixed length).\n",
      "        (?<!...) Matches if not preceded by ... (must be fixed length).\n",
      "        (?(id/name)yes|no) Matches yes pattern if the group with id/name matched,\n",
